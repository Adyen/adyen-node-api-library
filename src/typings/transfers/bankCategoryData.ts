    * The priority for the bank transfer. This sets the speed at which the transfer is sent and the fees that you have to pay. Required for transfers with `category` **bank**.  Possible values:  * **regular**: For normal, low-value transactions.  * **fast**: Faster way to transfer funds but has higher fees. Recommended for high-priority, low-value transactions.  * **wire**: Fastest way to transfer funds but has the highest fees. Recommended for high-priority, high-value transactions.  * **instant**: Instant way to transfer funds in [SEPA countries](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/integration/retail/sepa/html/index.en.html).  * **crossBorder**: High-value transfer to a recipient in a different country.  * **internal**: Transfer to an Adyen-issued business bank account (by bank account number/IBAN).
