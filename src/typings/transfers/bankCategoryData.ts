    * The priority for the bank transfer. This sets the speed at which the transfer is sent and the fees that you have to pay. Required for transfers with `category` **bank**.  Possible values:  * **regular**: for normal, low-value transactions.  * **fast**: a faster way to transfer funds, but the fees are higher. Recommended for high-priority, low-value transactions.  * **wire**: the fastest way to transfer funds, but this has the highest fees. Recommended for high-priority, high-value transactions.  * **instant**: for instant funds transfers within the United States and in [SEPA locations](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/integration/retail/sepa/html/index.en.html).  * **crossBorder**: for high-value transfers to a recipient in a different country.  * **internal**: for transfers to an Adyen-issued business bank account (by bank account number/IBAN).
