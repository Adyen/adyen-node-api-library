Possible values: * **completed**: the shopper completed the payment, and the payment was authorized. * **paymentPending**: the shopper is in the process of making the payment. This applies to payment methods with an asynchronous flow, like voucher payments where the shopper completes the payment in a physical shop. * **refused**: the session has been refused, because of too many refused payment attempts. The shopper can no longer complete the payment with this session. * **canceled**: the shopper canceled the payment. * **expired**: the session expired. The shopper can no longer complete the payment with this session. By default, the session expires one hour after it is created.
