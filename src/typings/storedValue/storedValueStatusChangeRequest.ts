If the shopper is present (online), you can supply also the CSC to improve authorisation (one-click payment). * `Moto` - Mail-order and telephone-order transactions where the shopper is in contact with the merchant via email or telephone. * `POS` - Point-of-sale transactions where the shopper is physically present to make a payment using a secure payment terminal.
