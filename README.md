## Prerequisites
-   [Adyen test account](https://docs.adyen.com/get-started-with-adyen). To start using Adyen APIs, you will need a Merchant Account.
-   [API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key). For testing, your API credential needs to have the [API PCI Payments role](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#roles).
-   Node 14 or higher

## Installation

You can use NPM to add our library to your project

### NPM

```bash
npm install --save @adyen/api-library
```

Alternatively, you can download the [release on GitHub](https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-node-api-library/releases).

## Upgrading

Please check the **[release page](https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-node-api-library/releases/)** to check for breaking changes in Major versions.

## Using the library

### Client initialisation
#### General use with API key
 
Set up the client as a singleton resource; you can then use it to create service objects for the API calls that you make to Adyen:
 
```typescript
  const { Client } = require('@adyen/api-library');
  const client = new Client({apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", environment: "TEST"});
``` 
#### General use with API key for live environment
 ```typescript
  const { Client } = require('@adyen/api-library');
  const client = new Client({apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", environment: "LIVE"});
 ``` 
#### General use with basic auth
```typescript
  const { Client } = require('@adyen/api-library');
  const client = new Client({username: "YOUR_USERNAME", password: "YOUR_PASSWORD", environment: "TEST"});
``` 

### Consuming Services
Every API the library supports is represented by a service object. The name of the service matching the corresponding API is listed in the [Integrations](#supported-api-versions) section of this document.
```javascript
  const { Client, CheckoutAPI	} = require('@adyen/api-library');
  const client = new Client({apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", environment: "TEST"});

  const paymentRequest = {
    amount: {
      currency: "USD",
      value: 1000 // value in minor units
    },
    reference: "Your order number",
    paymentMethod: {
      type: "scheme",
      encryptedCardNumber: "test_4111111111111111",
      encryptedExpiryMonth: "test_03",
      encryptedExpiryYear: "test_2030",
      encryptedSecurityCode: "test_737"
    },
    shopperReference: "YOUR_UNIQUE_SHOPPER_ID_IOfW3k9G2PvXFu2j",
    storePaymentMethod: true,
    shopperInteraction: "Ecommerce",
    recurringProcessingModel: "CardOnFile",
    returnUrl: "https://your-company.com/...",
    merchantAccount: "YOUR_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT"
  };
  const checkoutAPI = new CheckoutAPI(client);
  checkoutAPI.payments(paymentRequest)
    .then( paymentResponse => console.log(paymentResponse.pspReference))
    .catch(error => console.log(error));
```

Alternatively you can make use of the Types included in this library using Typescript, and/or use the async syntax:
```typescript
  const { Client, CheckoutAPI } = require('@adyen/api-library');
  const client = new Client({apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", environment: "TEST"});

  import { Types } from '@adyen/api-library';

  const doPaymentsRequest = async ()  => {
    const paymentRequest : Types.checkout.PaymentRequest = {
      amount: {
        currency: "USD",
        value: 1000 // value in minor units
      },
      reference: "Your order number",
      paymentMethod: {
        type: Types.checkout.CardDetails.TypeEnum.Scheme,
        encryptedCardNumber: "test_4111111111111111",
        encryptedExpiryMonth: "test_03",
        encryptedExpiryYear: "test_2030",
        encryptedSecurityCode: "test_737"
      },
      shopperReference: "YOUR_UNIQUE_SHOPPER_ID_IOfW3k9G2PvXFu2j",
      storePaymentMethod: true,
      shopperInteraction: Types.checkout.PaymentRequest.ShopperInteractionEnum.Ecommerce,
      recurringProcessingModel: Types.checkout.PaymentRequest.RecurringProcessingModelEnum.CardOnFile,
      returnUrl: "https://your-company.com/...",
      merchantAccount: "YOUR_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT"
    };
    const checkoutAPI = new CheckoutAPI(client);
    const paymentResponse : Types.checkout.PaymentResponse = await checkoutAPI.payments(paymentRequest);
    console.log(paymentResponse.pspReference);
  }

  doPaymentsRequest();
```
 
### Custom HTTP Client Configuration
By default, NodeJS [https](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html) will be used to submit requests to the API. But you can change that by injecting your own HttpClient on your client instance. In the example below, we use `axios`:

```javascript
const {Client, Config} = require('@adyen/api-library');
const axios = require("axios");
...
const config = new Config();
const client = new Client({
  config,
  httpClient: {
    async request(endpoint, json, config, isApiKeyRequired, requestOptions) {
        const response = await axios({
            method: 'POST',
            url: endpoint,
            data: JSON.parse(json),
            headers: {
                "X-API-Key": config.apiKey,
                "Content-type": "application/json"
            },
        });

        return response.data;
    }
  }
});
...
```

## Proxy configuration

You can configure a proxy connection by injecting your own HttpURLConnectionClient on your client instance and changing the `proxy` setter value.

Example:
```javascript
const {HttpURLConnectionClient, Client, Config} = require('@adyen/api-library');
...
const config = new Config();
const client = new Client({ config });
const httpClient = new HttpURLConnectionClient();
httpClient.proxy = { host: "http://google.com", port: 8888,  };

client.setEnvironment('TEST');
client.httpClient = httpClient;
...
```
