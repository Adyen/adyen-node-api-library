## Prerequisites
-   [Adyen test account](https://docs.adyen.com/get-started-with-adyen)
-   [API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key). For testing, your API credential needs to have the [API PCI Payments role](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#roles).
-   Node 12 or higher

## Installation

You can use NPM to add our library to your project

### NPM

```bash
npm install --save @adyen/api-library
```

Alternatively, you can download the [release on GitHub](https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-node-api-library/releases).


## Using the library

### General use with API key
 
Set up the client as a singleton resource; you can then use it to create service objects for the API calls that you make to Adyen:
 
```typescript
    const client = new Client({apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", environment: "TEST"});
``` 
### General use with API key for live environment
 ```typescript
     const client = new Client({apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", environment: "LIVE"});
 ``` 
### General use with basic auth
```typescript
    const client = new Client({username: "YOUR_USERNAME", password: "YOUR_PASSWORD", environment: "TEST"});
``` 
 
### Custom HTTP Client Configuration
By default, NodeJS [https](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html) will be used to submit requests to the API. But you can change that by injecting your own HttpClient on your client instance. In the example below, we use `axios`:

```javascript
const {Client, Config} = require('@adyen/api-library');
const axios = require("axios");
...
const config = new Config();
const client = new Client({
  config,
  httpClient: {
    async request(endpoint, json, config, isApiKeyRequired, requestOptions) {
        const response = await axios({
            method: 'POST',
            url: endpoint,
            data: JSON.parse(json),
            headers: {
                "X-API-Key": config.apiKey,
                "Content-type": "application/json"
            },
        });

        return response.data;
    }
  }
});
...
```

## Proxy configuration

You can configure a proxy connection by injecting your own HttpURLConnectionClient on your client instance and changing the `proxy` setter value.

Example:
```javascript
const {HttpURLConnectionClient, Client, Config} = require('@adyen/api-library');
...
const config = new Config();
const client = new Client({ config });
const httpClient = new HttpURLConnectionClient();
httpClient.proxy = { host: "http://google.com", port: 8888,  };

client.setEnvironment('TEST');
client.httpClient = httpClient;
...
```
